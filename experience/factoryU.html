        FactoryU is a research and development (R&D) lab at Scotiabank. The main
        focus of the lab is to bring in university students to work on new and
        innovative technology for the bank. During my time at FactoryU, our main
        focus was to develop the user interface (UI) of a
        <p class="highlight">machine learning</p>
        application (JAINUS) for predictive capital markets investments
        projected to increase revenue by
        <p class="highlight">$9 million</p>
        . The problem space for this project was the lack of trust users had in
        the machine learning model. Our goal is to use design thinking
        methodology to implement a UI that provides data to support the models
        recommendation.

      <h2 class="story-text">
        A majority of my time was spent developing the front-end of the
        application from scratch. JAINUSâ€™ UI was fully developed by 2 coop
        students and 1 full-time at FactoryU. With such a small team I relied
        heavily on my previous experiences and technical skills to learn and
        develop JAINUS using
        <p class="highlight">Angular, Redux, AgGrid,</p>
        and
        <p class="highlight">ChartJS</p>
        . Below is the iterative design process for JAINUS dashboard.

        At FactoryU, I was presented with the opportunity to take on more
        responsibility and act as a
        <p class="highlight">product manager</p>
        . Due to budgeting, FactoryU could not afford to hire a full-time
        product manager, and the role was dispersed throughout the team. My role
        was mainly surrounding
        <p class="highlight">
          translating stakeholder requirements into functional designs and
          specifications,
        </p>
        and
        <p class="highlight">
          envisioning, validating and prioritizing product features.
        </p>
        Through my experience in software development, I was able to discuss
        product features with stakeholders at a higher level and create an
        accurate
        <p class="highlight">product roadmap</p>
        to meet deadlines.
