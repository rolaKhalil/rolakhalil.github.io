      <h2 class="story-text">
        I started off my co-op journey working with Scotiabank's Continuous
        Integration and Delivery team optimizing internal tools through python
        scripts. After 1 month, I was noticed by
        <a class="highlight" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelvolgarev/"
          >Pavel Volgarev</a
        >, a product engineer for International Banking for my learning
        capabilites and interests in software development. I was transferred to
        work on the development of an internal application called
        <p class="highlight">Prism</p>
        . Through Prism, I was able to design, develop and test the application
        alongside a team of 4 people. This project allowed me to gain insight on
        various aspects of product development. What I learned was that I loved
        empathising with user needs and leveraging technology to solve problems.

        Ever since Prism, I have come to realize that I have a passion for using
        technology to impact peoples lives. Product management fit perfectly
        with what I loved doing. However, what I learned was that in order to be
        a successful product manager I needed to enhance my software development
        skills. This is important to me because in order to translate
        stakeholder requirements into functional designs and specifications, I
        needed to understand engineering and design. That is what lead me to my
        last two co-ops at
        <p class="highlight">tealbook</p>
        and
        <p class="highlight">FactoryU R&D</p>

        Outside of school and work, I like to spend my time staying physically
        active. My favourite activities include
