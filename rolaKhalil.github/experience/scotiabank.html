        For my first internship, I worked at Scotiabank’s Platform Organization
        (PLATO) division with the Continuous Integration and Delivery team. I
        created
        <p class="highlight">~30 python scripts</p>
        to optimize the banks applications like JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket,
        Jenkins, etc.

        After 1 month, I was recognized for my work by a product engineer and
        transferred over to the International Banking team. The remainder of my
        co-op term was spent on designing and developing an internal application
        called Prism.
        <p class="highlight">Prism</p>
        , uses JIRA sprint metrics to give insight about team performance for
        Scrum Masters. My role included translating user requirements into
        functional designs and specifications, designing y-frames and developing
        the front-end of the application. The goal of Prism is to advance the
        agile process for over
        <p class="highlight">3000 developers</p>
        at Scotiabank.
